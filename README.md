Recipes
This is my first project after starting The Odin Project.
I am going to use some HTML coding I have learnt to build a basic recipe website.

This will allow me to practice using different tags in HTML such as <a></a>, <img src> <h1></h1> etc and practise using Git commands and writing meaning commit messages.
