        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Jambalaya is a one-pot dish that's made with rice, meat or seafood,
               and vegetables. With French and Spanish influences, jambalaya is quite 
               similar to paella. The name "jambalaya" likely comes from the Proven√ßal
               word "jambalaia," which means mishmash.</p>
